                <p>   
                    Eliazar is currently a fulltime student and part time network admin at an IT provider. His strengths lie mostly in networking and batch scripting. He really enjoys programming and building big programs/projects from scratch. His TCP/IP knowledge along with his creativity and some python scripting will be very helpful in finding what a small population of students at Hunter are mostly interested in.
