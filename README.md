## Our Team

**Eli**

Eliazar is currently a fulltime student and network admin at a small IT provider. Although his strengths lie mostly in networking and batch scripting, he really enjoy programming and building big programs/projects from scratch. The thought of different tools and platforms communicating with each other to yield the same outcome is one of the things about computer science that fascinates him the most. He plans on using his networking skills along with his creativity to find ways to study this small population of students and have a better idea of what their interests are.

**Jia Yong**

Jiayong A.k.a. Leon, loves everything about computers. While he is studying for a bachelor degree in computer science, focusing software developing using c++ and java, he also interested in front-end and had experiences with html, css and javascript. He will be analyze incoming traffic from all users and visually present the results for customers.

**Oliver**

Oliver also loves computers! He is especially interested in decentralized software such as ipfs and cjdns. He is excited to learn more about computer networking and create a cool interface to the data we gather.

**Lila**

Lila is pursing a bachelor's degree in computer science and has a focus in pre med. She is interested in all aspects of the Capstone project and is willing to learn any new programming language that may be used for the project. She is also very excited to learn about the data obtained from packet sniffing and the networking security aspect of the project.

## Task List

### Week 1
[✔︎] Get acquainted with networking by reading [High Performance Browser Networking](https://hpbn.co)  
[✔︎] Think about what data we want to capture.
  - We are going to capture time and destination of each packet.
[✔︎] Think about how we want to visualize the data
  - Bar graph, 
[✔︎] Test packet sniffing in multiple areas of Hunter.

### Week 2
[ ] Run packet capturing code in real world and begin collecting data.
[ ] Solidify team roles.
[ ] Agree on which visualizations we will use.
